# qmlformat.nvim

Provides a nice tui to preview changes that qmlformat would make to your current buffer. 
As qmlformat would normally just format your file in-place with some changes you don't desire,
this allows you to preview the changes and handpick yourself which of these changes you would
like to introduce to the current file and which not.
